Overview
========

*MPFI.jl* strives to allow a high-level manipulation of intervals to obtain guaranteed and accurate results. This library builds upon the work done in `MPFI`_ and offers its capabilities in a Julian way, fully integrated with arbitrary precision types already avaliable, BigFloat and BigInt.

The documentation is still a work-in-progress, but hopefully it shall be complete soon.
